#Deploying an Ebola Vaccine

The Ebola outbreak that ravaged the West African region over the course of the last two years was the worst the world has ever seen. The devastation caused by this disease also made us stop and think about how lucky we are to be members of a society with the resources to combat an illness like Ebola. 

In that same moment my partner and I realized that we had a responsibility to utilize our resources to make a positive impact on Ebola prevention in whatever way possible. In response to the outbreak, world health leaders like Merck are designing vaccines to combat the virus and change world health. 

To aid in the effective deployment of a vaccine my partner and I have researched the spread rate, areas of high concentration, strategy risks, and patient income of the Ebola virus.

We used the analytic tools provided by EXCEL to clean and summarize the data. After we had the processed data we used the Geographical Information System tool to derive an geographical approach to solve Merck's questions.
